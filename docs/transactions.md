<h1>Transactions</h1>

One huge benefit of SQL databases over MongoDB is support for transactions,
which let you modify multiple rows in the database in an atomic way. This page
is about how to use them in Meteor; learn more about transactions in the
[PostgreSQL
tutorial](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/tutorial-transactions.html).


// XXX write this
// Note that the client-side stub is synchronous, so there is no need for a transaction
// Not clear if methods should be in a transaction by default
