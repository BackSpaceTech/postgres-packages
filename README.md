# Postgres Packages

Elephants don't fly, most of the time.

This is a heavily work in progress experimental exploration of what it would look like to use Postgres (and by extension, other SQL-like databases) with Meteor. Expect a lot of stuff to be broken for now until we announce that it's ready for preview usage. 

To see the patterns we are working with, check out the guide here: http://meteor-postgres.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
